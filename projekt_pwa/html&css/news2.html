                His middle fingers pointed toward the camera as he lay prone on a hospital bed and John McAfee swore vengeance on whoever allegedly tried to poison him. "My enemies maged [sic] to spike something that i ingested," he wrote in a June 2018 tweet, soon following up with pictures showing him lying in a hospital bed. "However, I am more difficult to kill than anyone can possibly imagine."

                McAfee, who reportedly earned $100 million by 1994 from selling shares in his eponymous computer security company, has since created a persona as an indulgent cryptocurrency analyst traveling the world.

                A 2016 documentary, Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee, details his life in Belize, featuring a former business owner who accused McAfee of rape. The film also features interviews that indicate the 73-year-old was involved in the 2012 murder of his neighbor, Gregory Faull, which prompted the programmer to flee the small Central American country on the Caribbean Sea. McAfee has repeatedly denied any involvement in the death, but In March a federal judge in Florida ordered McAfee to pay $25 million in a wrongful death suit brought by Faull's family.

                McAfee, who has self-exiled to Exuma, an island in the Bahamas, claiming that the IRS has convened a grand jury against him for not paying eight years of taxes, now draws attention for his tweets. His feed consists heavily of cryptocurrency commentary, but he also intermittently castigates the U.S. government and offers absurdist, sometimes offensive, social commentary, like the time he tweeted about whether having sex with a whale is consensual. (He told Newsweek that he tweeted about having sex with a whale to prove that people will believe anything if they trust youâ€”and tweeted that whale sex is definitely consensual.)
                
                McAfee is also running for president. Sort of.

                He doesn't want or expect to win. His hope, he told Newsweek, is to shift how Americans think and talk about political topics.

                His platform is minimal, but it centers around a point that many Americans can probably agree with: that the government no longer serves us. He maintains that he doesn't follow politics but thinks the U.S. is burdened by a bloated government and lawmakers who focus on maintaining their power, not serving the populace. He says that elected officials spend far too much time campaigning to keep their jobs.

                "We want someone going 'no I don't want to be it,' and we're going 'if you don't do it, we're going to string you up,'" he told Newsweek, noting that he blames voters for ushering the wrong people into office. "The problem is not the people in the government. The problem is us."
                
                McAfee identifies grievances but doesn't offer solutions, and, when asked if he sees similarities between his gruff, callous messaging and that of the current president, maintains he's not political.

                His answer to the governmental problems he sees feels distinctly similar to the film V for Vendetta; he wants people to "wake the f*** up."
